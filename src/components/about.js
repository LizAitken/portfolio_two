The problem solving process of creation first drew me towards the fine arts, then software development, and now UX/UI design. While designing a website for my artwork, I desired to go a bit further and do something outside of the template I was working in. Through that desire, I was introduced to a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After that, the world of software development and website design opened up and I climbed down the rabbit hole.
                        <br/> When I am not exploring the vast universe of UX/UI design, I am probably painting or adventuring the great outdoors with my husband and my pup.</p>
